About
==========

zuluplay is a fork of tcplay[1] and it is based on version 3.3 of tcplay. The only thing it adds
is the ability to set VeraCrypt's PIM value and the functionality is exposed only through the
library API.

This fork will no longer be used when this[2] feature request is implemented by upstream.
